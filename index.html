          <h3>Designing a Learning Space in Rajakylä School</h3>
          <p>During the Educational Project course in the University of Oulu, I have worked for Rajakylä primary school with three more members. The client request was to transform a storage room into a learning place for a new after-school activity. Through iterative processes, our group has drawn out solutions which satisfies the customer's needs.
            our group suggested a solution to meet the customer's needs.</p>

            <b>- For whom?</b> 3rd to 4th graders and teachers <br>
            <b>- Objective:</b> To transform a storageroom into a learning place with zero budget. <br>
            <b>- Technology used:</b> Room Creator, Lucidpress <br>
            <b>- Theoretical background:</b> Constructionism <br>
            <b>- Approach:</b> Finnish core national curriculum, The five learning environment dimension (Luminen, Rimpelä, & Granberg, 2015), collaborative learning, Design Thinking approach <br>
            <b>- Solution</b>: Pedagogical script and design plan of the learning space <br>

          <h3>€1 Science Maker</h3>
          <p>During the summer in 2017, my friend Megumi Iwata and I raised questions. Why learning science was so boring when we were in school? Are there any students who feel in the same way as we did? What if we trigger their interest and motivation in science with what we've learned in Finland? So voilà! €1 science, was born!</p>

            <b>- For whom?</b> Families having children aged 7 to 12 <br>
            <b>- Objective:</b> To deliver a message that playful learning can happen in everywhere for everyone. <br>
            <b>- Technology used:</b> Pepacura software, Adobe illustrator, Tinkercad, laser cutting, Arduino <br>
            <b>- Theoretical background:</b> Person-object theory of interest<br>
            <b>- Approach:</b> Physical computing, experiential learning <br>
            <b>- Solution:</b> Five hands-on activities were introduced using affordable materials such as straws, papers, ballons, and cooking foil. <br>

          <h3>Programming for Daughters</h3>
          <p>I decided to start this project after interviewing a girl taking a class in Fablab Oulu. The class was about building a small wooden house and installing a lamp using LED and Microbit. I noticed that most girls in the class were distracted. I asked a question to a group of girls. "Why are you guys not working for the acitivity?" Their answer made me think again about existing products and acitivities for coding used in classrooms. "It is boring and classes use only blocks and robots which are not cool". I kicked off the project to support girls like her who are novices in coding. The project could be proceeded with funding from KOFAC, the Korean governmant organization. </p>

          <b>- For whom?</b> Girls aged 10 to 12 who are new to learn coding <br>
          <b>- Objective:</b> To stimulate interest and internal motivation in learning <br>
          <b>- Technology used:</b> Microbit, Arduino Lilypad, Adobe Premier, Adobe Effect<br>
          <b>- Theoretical background:</b> The four-phase model of interest, Emotion and Long-term memory (Tyng, Amin, Saad, & Malik, 2017)<br>
          <b>- Solution:</b> Video tutorials and digital design files to make interactive toys <br>

          <h3>Hacked Himmeli</h3>
          <p>This project was inspired by Finnish tradition Himmeli. Himmeli is an geometric ornament that Finns hang on a ceiling during Christmas season. I found Himmeli could be a fun activitiy to learn a good mix of art and math by creating tangible mobiles. I extended the activity into coding classes where students can make interactive Himmeli with Microbit and microservo.</p>
          <b>- For whom?</b> Public <br>
          <b>- Objective:</b> To inspire people how geometric and programming are integrated into art <br>
          <b>- Technology used:</b> Microbit, Canva, Adobe Premier, Adobe Effect<br>
          <b>- Solution:</b> Video tutorials, written manuals, ready-made examples to dissect and to identify geometric structures

          <h3>Tech-craft</h3>
          <p>Visitng Newyork in October 2017, I had a wonderful chance to share my educational vision and projects which combine handcraft activities and programming. At that time, teachers kept asking the same questions; they wanted to implement the activities in their classrooms but they were afraid to do due to the zero understanding in coding. In order to lower the barrier for those teachers, a prototype blended-learning course for physical computing was developed and tested out. The project has been extended to my master's thesis with a different topic. The research was published as a science paper in Association for Computing Machinery(ACM) in 2018.</p>

          <b>- For whom?</b> People who want to learn coding but afraid to start <br>
          <b>- Objective:</b> To lower barrier to learn to code<br>
          <b>- Technology used:</b> Arduino, Adobe illustrator, Adobe Premier, Adobe Effect<br>
          <b>- Theoretical background:</b> Contextualized computing, Didactic triagle, triggering interest <br>
          <b>- Solution:</b> Blended learning course curriculum, video tutorials, digital files

          <h3>Organizing Mini Maker Faire Aarhus</h3>
          <p>During the internship at Dokk1 in Denmark, I worked with the Taskforce to hold Mini Maker Faire Aarhus. Maker Faire is an international event where people can share their projects to public. Mini Maker Faire Aarhus has been hold for two days and over 1000 audiences visitied the event. Throught the experience I learned project management skills, especially regarding how to draw the best results out of the specified budget in order to reach the organization's strategies. </p>

          <b>- For whom?</b> Anyone <br>
          <b>- Objective:</b> To create an environment where people can share their expertise and hobbies.<br>
